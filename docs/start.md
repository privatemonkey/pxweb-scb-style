## Customizing

### Colors

### Fonts and typography

The default setup uses the variable font "Public Sans" which was developed for US government sites. The font has great support for various languages and has a low footprint. The fallback is a system font stack using each operating systems "web"-font.

### Logo, icons and images

### Margins and paddings

## Optimize for speed

The PxWeb alternative style has only a 1/10 the size footprint of the regulars CSS. The number of request has been reduced from 25-28 to a meager 4-8.

If bandwidth and speed is a concern you can reduce the number of requests even further making your pages even faster.

1. Use the system fallback fonts
2. Use an SVG and inline CSS version of your logo
3. Use an SVG and inline CSS version of quality logo

This will take reduce the number of CSS, font and media related request down to **2**!!
